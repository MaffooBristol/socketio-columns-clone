socketio-columns-clone
======================

Soon to be a multiplayer node/socket.io clone of the MegaDrive game Columns.

At the moment, it's just a procedural 'sketch' of the way a game will pan out without timing or user interaction. The code is also not structured, but that's intentional. In the future it will be a fully real-time implementation. For now it's not that impressive.
